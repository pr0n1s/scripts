map-fs.py (Python 2.7.6): 
  post-exploitation script used on UNIX/Linux systems to map the file 
  system from the directory passed on the command line.
  
  Example:
    python map-fs.py /

    Traverses all directories and respective subdirectories from the root
    directory, there by displaying all files with the following data:
